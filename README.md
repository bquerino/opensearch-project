## Overview üìñ

The **Payment Processor API** is a robust and scalable solution designed for processing and managing payments. The project is built using modern Java practices and leverages the power of **Spring Boot**, **Hibernate Search**, **Opensearch** and **Redis** to provide efficient and scalable search capabilities over payment data.

## Features ‚ú®

- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**: The project follows the principles of DDD, ensuring that the business logic is encapsulated within the domain layer.
- **Hibernate Search**: Integrated with Opensearch to provide full-text search capabilities.
- **PostgreSQL**: Used as the primary relational database for persistence.
- **Redis**: Used to cache results after GET operations.
- **Modular Architecture**: The project is organized into multiple modules for better separation of concerns and maintainability.

## Project Structure üèóÔ∏è

The project is divided into several modules, each with a specific responsibility:

### 1. `payment-processor-domain`
This module contains the core business logic and domain models. The domain models are implemented using plain Java objects (POJOs) and are responsible for enforcing business rules.

### 2. `payment-processor-repository`
This module handles the data persistence logic. It maps domain models to the database entities using **JPA** and **Hibernate Search**. The repository layer interacts with PostgreSQL and Opensearch.

### 3. `payment-processor-service`
The service layer contains business services that orchestrate the operations between the domain and repository layers. It uses **DTOs** (Data Transfer Objects) to transfer data between layers.

### 4. `payment-processor-api`
This module exposes RESTful APIs for external clients. It handles HTTP requests and responses and interacts with the service layer to process payments and perform searches.

## Setup and Installation üöÄ

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

### **Prerequisites**

* Java 17
* Maven 3.8+
* PostgreSQL 12+
* Opensearch 2.16

### **Steps**

- Clone the repository
- Build the project
```bash
mvn clean install
```
- Start the infrastructure using Docker Compose:

```bash
  cd infrastructure
  docker-compose up
```
- Run the application.
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

- To stop and remove the infrastructure run the following:
```bash
docker-compose down -v
```

### **View data**
